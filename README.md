Scene created in blender following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7m3QkwRcGE&t=1148s) by Grant Abbitt and imported as FBX using threeJs based on [this repo](https://github.com/MagnusBrzenk/threejs-typescript-boilerplate.git)

The FBX file has one sun-type light source, which the threeJs loader converts to a DirectionalLight. I've also added a ThreeJs simple light option in order to see the well in more close-up detail.
